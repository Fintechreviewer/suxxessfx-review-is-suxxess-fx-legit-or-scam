    <h2>üö® SuxxessFX.com: A Fraudulent Forex Broker üö®</h2>
    <p>SuxxessFX, operating at <a href="https://suxxessfx.com" target="_blank">suxxessfx.com</a>, is a scam forex broker that falsely claims to be regulated by the Financial Services Authority of Seychelles (FSA) under license number SD204. However, a quick check of the FSA's official list of licensed entities reveals that SuxxessFX is <strong>not listed</strong>. The FSA has also issued warnings about fraudulent companies cloning their website and forging licenses. You can read the official FSA warning <a href="https://fsaseychelles.sc/media-corner/regulatory-updates/alert-cloning-of-the-fsa-website-and-forgery-of-securities-dealer-licence" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
