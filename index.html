    <h2>🚨 SuxxessFX.com: A Fraudulent Forex Broker 🚨</h2>
    <p>SuxxessFX, operating at <a href="https://suxxessfx.com" target="_blank">suxxessfx.com</a>, is a scam forex broker that falsely claims to be regulated by the Financial Services Authority of Seychelles (FSA) under license number SD204. However, a quick check of the FSA's official list of licensed entities reveals that SuxxessFX is <strong>not listed</strong>. The FSA has also issued warnings about fraudulent companies cloning their website and forging licenses. You can read the official FSA warning <a href="https://fsaseychelles.sc/media-corner/regulatory-updates/alert-cloning-of-the-fsa-website-and-forgery-of-securities-dealer-licence" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>📅 SuxxessFX.com Was Created in January 2025</h2>
    <p>SuxxessFX.com is a very new website with no track record or user reviews. Trusting them with your funds would be a <strong>big mistake</strong>. The broker operates as a market maker, which means they profit when you lose trades. Winning trades and making money on a consistent basis is nearly impossible with such brokers.</p>

    <h2>🛑 Why You Should Avoid SuxxessFX</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>❌ Fake regulation and license</li>
        <li>❌ No presence on the FSA's official list</li>
        <li>❌ Uses WebTrader instead of the popular MT4/5 platform</li>
        <li>❌ Operates as a market maker, not a true ECN or STP broker</li>
        <li>❌ No user reviews or track record</li>
    </ul>
